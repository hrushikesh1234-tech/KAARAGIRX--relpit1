1)the login and register is not working 
2) when i want to register new professional or customer or rental merchand or material dealer then we should be create account and then our profile dashboard should be there as per our role if i register as contractor or architect then that dashboard should be there where i can list my portfolio and about us   and that prortfolio , about and reviews of that contractor architects should be visible in listing page ,         if i am register and login as material dealer then that respective profile dashboard should open where i should be able to list my materials and tell about us , rating .  that materials should be added in Shop material list as per catagory in real time.     and when we register and login as rental merchant then it should have respective dashboard where he can list his rental equipments and those should be visible in Onrent listing as per catagory in real time ,              when we register and login as a customer then we should have respective dashboard and he should be able to see his orders , his rental bookings , his wishlist , liked professionals , track orders.       
3) there should be one admin dashboard for our teams because we dont want to go to database to see orders and all , so admin dashboard where we can see all the orders and approve those orders , all bookings and approve those bookings , list of the total number of customers and professionals,      basically when anyone wants to make any order suppose customer send order request then that request has to be come on admin dashboard with details (who order , order details , from whom he want, customer contact number and dealer or rental merchant contact number )  then our team first call the dealer and rental merchant and ask and confirm either he has stock available or allow in customers location , and  dilevery charges and develery duration , when get approval from dealer or merchant he we again confirm the order by calling customer to find is he really want that order or placed by mistake, then take advance payment from that customer online then place order.    the admin dashboard shaould have all the details of our business day by day income , this months income , last incomes etc. give one admin button to go to admin panel from login page.    
4) check database working properly , everythink working properly , perfectly login and registers,   correct dashboard should be there for correct role. dashboard should take real time data , and make sure it shows in our respective listing pages. it shows fail to fetch dealer information when i login as dealer same for rental merchant , home screen for this logins also not loading ,   when we are logged out and click on dashboard then in that login form there should be 2 buttons , register as customer  and register as professional ,  if they click on register as customer then in register form there should be only customer role should be there if we click on register as professional then our current register page should open (which has 4 roles) .
